      "**Summary:** The new regulation tightens the definition and scope of consent, emphasizing explicit, informed, and prior consent before any non-essential cookies are set.  \n",
      "**Analysis:** This change increases the burden on website operators to obtain clear, unambiguous consent before placing cookies that are not strictly necessary. It affects all data controllers and processors operating in the EU, requiring more transparent consent mechanisms and stricter compliance to avoid penalties. This aligns with the 2025 enforcement trend toward penalizing dark patterns and pre-ticked boxes.  \n",
      "**Change:** The new regulation explicitly requires \"prior consent\" and forbids any non-essential cookies before consent is given, with detailed requirements on consent being \"freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.\"  \n",
      "**Before_quote:**  \n",
      "\"Consent must be obtained prior to the storage or access of information on the user's device, and it must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.\" (Page 3, Section 2.1)  \n",

      "**Analysis:** This change mandates that users must be able to accept or reject cookie categories individually (e.g., analytics, advertising, functionality), preventing blanket acceptance. This increases user control and transparency but requires more complex consent management platforms. It impacts all websites using multiple cookie types.  \n",

This facilitates enforcement and user rights but increases administrative overhead. It affects all organizations processing cookie consent data.  \n",
