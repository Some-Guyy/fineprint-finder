      "The key change in the data privacy regulation is that **personal data can no longer be stored indefinitely without user consent**; instead, **personal data must be deleted after 2 years unless the user renews their consent**. This introduces a clear time limit on data retention and requires active consent renewal to continue storing data beyond that period.\n",

      "This change reflects a shift toward stronger data protection principles such as **data minimization** and **purpose limitation**, which are common in recent privacy laws taking effect in 2025 across various U.S. states. These laws emphasize limiting data retention to what is necessary and ensuring transparency and user control over personal data[1][2][3].\n",
